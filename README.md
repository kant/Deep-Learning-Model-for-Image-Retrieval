# Deep-Learning-Model-for-Image-Retrieval
Deep Learning Model for image clasification using deep features. 
The objective of this scrip is to train a model with any set of images, using deep features, by appling the Trasnfer Learning technique from the imagenet Model that was previsuly trained with over a million images

Following I display the first rows of the trianing data for better understanding of the model
